        <p className='my-4'>
          Founded in 2023, BookSwap was born out of a shared passion for literature and a commitment to sustainability.
          We noticed the growing need for a platform where avid readers could exchange their beloved books, making reading more economical and environmentally friendly.
          BookSwap emerged as the answer to this call, providing a space where book enthusiasts can discover hidden gems, share their literary treasures, and connect with like-minded individuals.
